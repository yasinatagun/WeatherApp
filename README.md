# WeatherApp
 To create this Weather App,
 I used several packages:
 - intl
 - Bloc
 - Geolocator
 - Weather

My application using OpenWeatherApi and fetching current weather conditions "location based".
Also I set several functions like changing weather icons, changing background depends on my weather state.

(IMPORTANT) I created this project for learning Flutter better and using State Management in my app. This is one of my first practice projects in Flutter.
